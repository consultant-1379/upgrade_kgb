### Function: NTP_SERVER_INSTALLED ###
#
# check that ntp server is installed
#
# Arguments:
#    none
#
# Return Values:

# 0 if ntp package installed, non-zero if not installed

function NTP_SERVER_INSTALLED(){
	pkginfo | grep SUNWntpr >/dev/null 
	return $?

}

### Function: NTP_SERVER_RUNNING ###
#
# check that ntp server is running
#
# Arguments:
#    none
#
# Return Values:
#    0 if ntp service is running and 1 otherwise

function NTP_SERVER_RUNNING() {
	svcs svc:/network/ntp:default > /dev/null
    	return $?
}


### Function: NTP_QUERY_SUCCESS ###
#
# check that ntp query executed successfully
#
# Arguments:
#    none
#
# Return Values:
#    0 if ntp query successful. A non-zero value means ntp query was unsuccessful 

function NTP_QUERY_SUCCESS(){
	ntpq -p >/dev/null 2>&1
	return $?
}


### Function: NTP_QUERY_RESPONSE ###
#
# returns the ntp query  data 
#
# Arguments:
#    none
#
# Return Values: Each line of data incdlude the collumns in the order below:
#1. remote: The IP address or DNS name of the remote server 
#2. refid:  An identification of the type of the reference clock. 
#3. st:     The "stratum" or level of the server: for almost all systems, 2 is great. Your local system will have a higher number. 
#4. t:     The type of service. Your setup will show "l" for local on your local system, or "u" for "unicast" for communicating with remote servers. 
#5. when:  This is the number of seconds since the server was last heard from. After a couple of minutes of operation your server should start to report numeric values here. 
#6. poll:  Current polling interval in seconds. When remote servers are responding, "when" should be no greater than "poll". 
#7. reach: This and the remaining fields are important indicators of the health of your local server, your remote servers, and their communication. This field is really a bit array indicating whether responses have been received to your local server's eight most recent requests. The value starts at 0. If your local server is receiving responses to all its requests, it will go to 1, then 3, then 7. The display is in octal, so 377 is the maximum value. Anything less indicates that either your local server recently started or some requests did not receive responses. 
#8 delay:  Recent average roundtrip time in milliseconds from request to response. 
#9 offset:    Estimated differential between your system clock and this time server's clock, in milliseconds. You may consider this the "bottom line" on the accuracy of your system clock. NTP can usually drive this down to the level of the jitter or less. 
#10 jitter:    A measure of the variability of the delays between request and receipt of a response, in milliseconds. High jitter tends to limit your server's ability to synchronize accurately. 

function NTP_QUERY_RESPONSE(){
	QUERY_RESPONSE=`ntpq -p 2>/dev/null|tail --line=+3`  
}


### Function: NTP_UPSTREAM_SERVERS ###
#
# returns  a list of ntp upstream servers 
#
# Arguments:
#    none
#
# Return Values: List of upstream ntp servers 

function NTP_UPSTREAM_SERVERS(){
	UPSTREAM_SERVERS=`ntpq -p 2>/dev/null |awk '$4 ~ /^u$/{print $1}'`
}
