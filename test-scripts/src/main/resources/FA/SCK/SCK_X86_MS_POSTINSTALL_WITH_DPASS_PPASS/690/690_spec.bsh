#The following chapter describes generating and migrating initial LDAP Name
#Service Data and Initializing the Master Server as an LDAP Name Service
#Client.
#There are two scenarios:
#• If the ppass anddpass boot argument parameters are used, the Master
#Server is automatically configured as an LDAP client. .
#• If the ppassand dpass boot argument parameters are not used, the
#Master Server is not automatically configured as an LDAP client. In this
#scenario a number of additional steps are required.
#The following steps describe how to configure the Master Server as an LDAP
#client, and migrate the Master Server data to the LDAP Server if the ppass
#and boot dpass argument parameters are used.
#1. Generate the LDAP name service data on the OSS Master Server:
##/opt/ericsson/sck/bin/configure_ldap.bsh -g -y
#2. The LDAP migration data is generated in:
#/var/tmp/ossldap/migrate/ldap_mig_files
#The post-migration Master Server files are generated in:
#/var/tmp/ossldap/migrate/post_mig_etc_files
#The log file is:
#/var/tmp/ossldap/migrate/logs/configure_ldap_log_<tim
#estamp>.log
#3. Migrate the LDAP name service data from the OSS Master Server to the
#O&M Services Server. The migration of the LDAP data, generated in the
#previous step, is started as follows:
## /opt/ericsson/sck/bin/configure_ldap.bsh -m
#4. Install the Master Server post-migration files (remove migrated users and
#groups from Master Server files):
## /opt/ericsson/sck/bin/configure_ldap.bsh -e
#5. Finalize LDAP client setup:
## /opt/ericsson/sck/bin/maintain_ldap.bsh
