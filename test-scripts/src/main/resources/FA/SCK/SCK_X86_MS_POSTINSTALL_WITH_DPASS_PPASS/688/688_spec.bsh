#Configuring SSH for LDAP User Administration
#A one-way trust relationship from the O&M Infra/O&M Services Servers or
#OMSAS to the Master server is required to enable the user administration
#scripts on those servers to add or remove users on MS.
#This section must be completed for each O&M Infra/O&M Services Server
#and OMSAS.
#18.1 SSH Configuration
#18.1.1 Configuring SSH in Upgrade or Multiple OSS Domains
#Verify that a SSH public/private key pair (/.ssh/id_dsa and
#/.ssh/id_dsa.pub) exist on the O&M Infra/O&M Services.
##ls -la /.ssh
#id_dsa id_dsa.pub
#If /.ssh/id_dsa and /.ssh/id_dsa.pub) already exist, proceed with
#Section 18.1.3 on page 175.
#If /.ssh/id_dsa and /.ssh/id_dsa.pub) do NOT exist, then proceed with
#Section 18.1.2 on page 174.
#18.1.2 Configuring SSH in Single OSS Domain
#Generate a public/private key pair by execute the following commands on the
#O&M Infra/O&M Services or OMSAS:
#1. Verify the /.ssh directory exists, if not create it
## mkdir /.ssh
#2. Change the permissions:
##chmod 0700 /.ssh
##cd /.ssh
#3. Create a public/private key:
## ssh-keygen -t dsa
#Generating public/private dsa key pair
#Enter file in which to save the key (//.ssh/id_dsa):
#//.ssh/id_dsa
#Enter passphrase : <Passphrase>
#Enter same passphrase again: <Passphrase>
#Your identification has been saved in //.ssh/id_dsa.
#Your public key has been saved in //.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
#The key fingerprint is: b6:74:c6:79:03:5a:82:e6:18:9
#0:ac:e0:b6:78:1d:af
#4. This creates id_dsa and id_dsa.pub under /.ssh. A phrase
#value is needed to protect the private key in the file system. It is used
#once the communication is initiated with the OSS Admin Server. This
#phrase/password must be different from the OSS Admin Server root
#password.
#18.1.3 Configuring SSH for User comnfadm
#1. On OSS Admin Server, verify that the SSH key authorized_keys2
#exists for the usercomnfadm in directory /home/comnfadm/.ssh. If the
#keys already exist in /home/comnfadm/.ssh directory then verify the
#SSH setup with Step 5 Page 176.
#2. If the keys do not exist, they must be created. Execute the following on the
#OSS Admin Server:
#Verify that the directory /home/comnfadm/.ssh exists, if not create it
## su - comnfadm
## mkdir -p /home/comnfadm/.ssh
## exit
#3. Securely copy the public key to the OSS Admin Server. Execute the
#following on the O&M Infra/O&M Services:
#Note: If OSS Admin Server has been upgraded and the SSH keys are
#copied using scp from O&M Infra/O&M Services Server to OSS
#Admin Server, it may prompt for SSH Passphrase instead of root
#password.
## scp id_dsa.pub <IP Address of OSS Admin Server>:/home
#/comnfadm/.ssh/OMINFServer.pub
#scp id_dsa.pub 10.0.0.22:/home/comnfadm/.ssh/OMINFSe
#rver.pub
#The authenticity of host '10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)' can't
#be established.
#RSA key fingerprint is 23:b0:10:cb:d5:8a:f9:54:84:9a:87
#:5f:41:58:83:0c
#Are you sure you want to continue connecting
#(yes/no)?yes
#Warning: Permanently added '10.0.0.2' (RSA) to the
#list of known hosts.
#Password: <OSS Admin Server Root Password>
#id_dsa.pub
#|***************************************************|
#602 00:00
## chmod 0600 /.ssh
#4. Log onto the MS and append the O&M Infra/O&M Services Server public
#key to the authorized key file:
##cd /home/comnfadm/.ssh
## cat OMINFServer.pub >> authorized_keys2
#Remove the OMINFServer public key from the file system and secure
#the /.ssh directory:
##rm OMINFServer.pub
## chown -R comnfadm:other /home/comnfadm/.ssh/
## chmod -R 0700 /home/comnfadm/.ssh/
#5. Test SSH configuration on the O&M Infra/O&M Services:
## ssh -l comnfadm <OSS-RC Master Server IP address>
#Enter passphrase for key '/.ssh/id_dsa': <Passphrase>
