# BEGIN_MANUAL_STEPS
#The following procedure describes the steps to define the mirror definition on
#Admin Server as user root
##cd /ericsson/dmr/bin
## ./dmtool
#Note: Disk device names in the following sections are examples from a test
#site and must be adapted to the local site-specific configuration.
#When DMR is started for the first time it asks for a mirror definition. The steps
#are described in Example 33.
#Example 33 DMR Steps
## cd /ericsson/dmr/bin
## ./dmtool
#---------------< D M R >-----------------
#-----------< Define mirrors >------------
#NO MIRROR DEFINITION FOUND!
#PLEASE PAY ATTENTION!
#THE DEFINTION WILL BE USED FROM NOW ON.
#How many mirrors should be defined (1-n) [2]:
#Mirror 1 Mirror 2
#------------ ------------ ------------ -----------
#d11 c0t0d0s2 d12 c0t1d0s2
#disk2 c1t44d0s2 disk2mirr c2t44d0s2
#disk3 c1t44d1s2 disk3mirr c2t44d1s2
#Is this a good mirror definition (y/n)? [y] y
#Note:
#• If the slices are not included in the Disks implement the steps
#described in Section 16.7.8 on page 143
#• EFI disks and EBN disks don’t have ’s2’, so it’s not an error if they
#don’t. But the root disks always have ’s2’.
#Finally check dm_define that it contains disks found in vxdisk list:
## cat /ericsson/dmr/etc/dm_define
# END_MANUAL_STEPS

# BEGIN_POST_CONDITIONS
#metastat command should show the mirrors defined
# END_POST_CONDITIONS
