# ATCOMINF Test Callback Library

# Revision History
# <date>	<signum>	<details>

# Complete the callbacks in this library to automate the test case.
#
# Callbacks are stateless, it is not possible to set a global variable in one callback 
# and access it it in another.
#
# Callbacks are called by the test harness in the following order:
#
# tc_setup() 		# Called only for independent TC execution mode to setup TC
# tc_precon()		# Conditions that should exist before TC can run
# tc_test()		# Runs the test for this TC
# tc_postcon()		# Conditions that should/should not exist after successful TC 
# tc_cleanup()		# Called only for independent TC execution mode to cleanup after TC

# All callbacks must PASS for a TC PASS result

#################################################################################
#
# CALLBACK: TC_SETUP
#
# This callback function is only called if the harness execution mode is 'AT_INDEPENDENT'
#
# Return or exit codes:
#  0	success
# >0 	failure

tc_setup() {

	# Coded to fail in case TC_AUTOMATED=1 before automation completed
	# Change return code as required
	touch /tmp/adtmp23004.log || 1
        # remove module status file if exists
        if [ -f /ericsson/config/.admin_post_upgrade_tasks_status_file ]; then
            rm /ericsson/config/.admin_post_upgrade_tasks_status_file || 1

# CALLBACK: TC_PRECON
#
# This callback function checks the correct conditions exist to run the TC.
#
# Return or exit codes:

#
# CALLBACK: TC_TEST
#
# This callback function runs the test.
# The harness compares the return code to the SPEC_TC_TEST_PASSCODE value set in the test spec.
#
# Return or exit codes:
#    SPEC_TC_TEST_PASSCODE 	success
# != SPEC_TC_TEST_PASSCODE 	failure
